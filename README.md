# series1
# ex = 1,2,4,8,16,23,28,.....
It's a series that starts with a given lower range and gets added with the digits of that number and by this process, a new number is formed and again this same process gets continued for that new number!
# This process works until the upper range of the series
# The user gives the upper range and lower range
